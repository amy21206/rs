<h4>Please Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 75,000 students registered on Runestone Academy for the 2022/2023 school year?
    At $150 a textbook we saved students over $11 million! Thats
    a lot of students and a lot of savings. It takes a lot of work to keep this site up
    and growing. We are adding new features and improvements all the time. Please
    consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a> or ask your institution to support
    Runestone. If every school sent us $100 per class we would be fully sustainable and
    could add support staff.

<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
