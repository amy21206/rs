Adding a New Feature Server Side
--------------------------------

Most new features to Runestone take the form of a new API endpoint with or without a UX.  The UX is usually a new page in the web2py server.  The API endpoint is usually in the book_server_api or author_server_api.  A lot of the code for a new feature typically revolves around working with the database.  All servers in the monorepo share the same database.  The database is a postgresql database, and the model for the database resides in the ``rsptx.db.models`` module.  The elements of the module are defined using the ``sqlalchemy`` library.  In addition, most models have a corresponding validator provided by the Pydantic library.  In your code you should use these pydantic validators.  They ensure that your code is using the correct types.  They also provide a convenient way to convert the data from the database into a python dictionary.  The pydantic validators are defined in the ``rsptx.common.schemas`` module.

Finally, to create, retrieve, update or delete (crud) elements from the database you should use the ``rsptx.db.crud`` module.  This module provides a convenient way to interact with the database.  Most database actions are already there, so you just need to call the appropriate function.  If you need a new function, or expand the model to add a new table, we encourage you to write functions for the most common operations.    the ``crud`` module also provides a way to validate the data that you are trying to store in the database.  The ``crud`` module is used by the API endpoints and UX controllers to interact with the database.  You should NOT write database queries directly in your API endpoints.  Instead you should use the ``rsptx.db.crud`` module.

If your endpoint is going to be part of the book server, you should look at the routers in the ``rsptx.book_server_api.routers`` module.  If your endpoint is going to be part of the author server, you should look at the routers in the ``rsptx.author_server_api`` module.  


.. note:: web2py is deprecated 
   
      The web2py server is deprecated.  It is still used for the instructor interface, login/logout, practice. The API endpoints for interaction in a book have moved to the book server, we are currently moving the endpoints for assignments, peer instruction and practice to the assignment server.  After that we will develop a new server dedicated to managing authentication.  The new server will be a FastAPI server that will be used by the book server, author server, assignment server, etc.  The web2py server will be removed from the monorepo in the future.
